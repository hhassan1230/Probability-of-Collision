# Probability of Collision [exercise]
```
\  Car 1|
  \     |
    \   |
Car 2 \ |  LEFT  | STRAIGHT | RIGHT
___________________________________
  LEFT  |  0.5   |  0.25    | 0.1
STRAIGHT|  0.25  |  0.02    | 0.1
 RIGHT  |  0.1   |  0.1     | 0.01
```
The truth table shown above represents the probability of two cars colliding at an intersection if they both attempt a maneuver at the same time. If Car 1 goes straight and car two goes left, for example, there is a probability of collision of 0.25.
